# Video to Frame: Object Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to parse a video file, extract frames, and perform object detection on each frame using a pre-trained model. The primary objective is to identify and annotate objects within the video, providing valuable insights and analysis.

## Features

- **Video Parsing:** The script can parse various video formats to extract individual frames for further analysis.

- **Frame Extraction:** Extract frames at a specified frame rate from the video file, enabling detailed analysis of the video content.

- **Object Detection:** Utilize a pre-trained object detection model to identify and annotate objects within each extracted frame.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Any additional dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
